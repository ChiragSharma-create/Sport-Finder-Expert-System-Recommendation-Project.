# Sport-Finder-Expert-System-Recommendation-Project.
I created a code that Recommends the user a sport that would be best suited for them according to their personality.
I used some functions in my code such as:
Function greeting() – Welcomes the user and explains what the program does.
Function askQuestions() – Asks the user four questions about their preferences (team or solo, indoor or outdoor, endurance or quick energy, contact or no contact). It also validates each input so the user can’t type random letters.
Function recommendSport() – Uses a set of if-else statements to pick a sport that matches the user’s answers. For example, outdoor team sports with contact = Soccer, outdoor team sports without contact = Beach Volleyball, etc.
main() function – Runs the whole program. It greets the user, loops through the quiz, and asks if they want to try again. The loop continues until the user says no.
